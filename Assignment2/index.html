        <h1>GLOBAL LIFE SATISFACTION REPORT</h1>
        <p class="justify">Data source obtained from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction">Our World in Data</a> (2021)</p>
        <small>Note that, the data is mostly obtained from 2020 in exception of some countries where the latest available data is not available in the same year.</small>
        <p>Life satisfaction is a significant indicator of societal well-being. Moreover, the rapid development in different countries’ economies has led to the question of to what extent GDP can capture societal progress, helping researchers analyse and draw meaningful conclusions to improve everyone’s quality of life.
          <br>It is essential to understand that “life satisfaction” and “happiness” are not precisely synonyms. The two variables come from asking different questions, and it is found that the significant difference in responses to the questions is consistent with the idea that well-being can be interpreted in two different ways: emotional and cognitive-based. However, both types still measure both aspects to a certain degree, as most researchers believe a highly positive link between the two variables. Hence, this report uses the terms nearly interchangeably, as shown subsequently.

          <h3>Overview of Life Satisfaction Across The World</h3>
          <p class="justify">More than 160 countries were taken into account in 140 languages to prevent the surveyors from misinterpreting the questions. As you can see, the map denotes that Europe has a higher probability of a life satisfaction rate, whereas most countries in Africa have a low rate of life satisfaction. This fact has led to considerable research about the potential correlation between life satisfaction and other well-being measures, which will be discussed more thoroughly in the next section.

          <p class="justify">Specifically, there are significant gaps between the countries, and the most recent figures revealed that European countries attain the highest ranking, such as Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland and Netherlands. In contrast, the lowest satisfaction scores correspond to Afghanistan, South Sudan, Lebanon, Zimbabwe and Rwanda, located in the Middle East and Africa.

          <h3>Life Satisfaction and Income</h3>
          <p class="justify">The historical data measuring satisfaction rate and GDP per capita has proved a positive correlation between these two variables. This means more prosperous and developed countries tend to show higher levels of average happiness and the other way around.

          <p class="justify"><br><br>There is no clear correlation between depression and life satisfaction, as shown <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/depression-vs-self-reported-life-satisfaction">here</a>. Nonetheless, at a “micro-level” within country correlations, there is an apparent link between health and well-being within countries in general and mental health self-reported life satisfaction in particular. Each bar only shows conditional correlation, i.e., it has been filtered out after accounting for other factors. Furthermore, the values are represented in negative values, meaning that individuals diagnosed with depression or anxiety are more likely to have lower self-reported satisfaction scores. Experts have concluded that there are two potential ways of relationships: depressed and anxious people tend to be less happy, and unhappy individuals are more likely to be depressed and/or anxious. Psychologically, people often group feelings such as anxiety, depression and unhappiness.

        <p>Interestingly, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165178100001682">other papers</a> give further evidence that treatment for depression is positively linked to increases in life satisfaction rate.
